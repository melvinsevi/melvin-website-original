# Portfolio

## Summary
I am a final-year Master of Research student in the Mathematics, Vision, Apprentissage (MVA) program at ENS Paris-Saclay, the most prestigious master's degree in machine learning in France. My main research interests include Computer Vision and multimodal learning, with a specific focus on Generative AI, Diffusion Models, and Large Language Models. I am eager to pursue a Ph.D. to delve deeper into these areas and contribute to the cutting-edge research in the field.

## Projects
- **Text-to-Image generation control with IP-Adapter (Project at the MVA)**
  - On going
  - I am contributing to the development of the IP-Adapter model for text-to-image generation by enhancing its creative capabilities. By modifying the existing architecture, we aim to increase the expressiveness and variability of generated images while maintaining high levels of fidelity and realism.

- **Refining image segmentation through diffusion models (Project at the MVA)**
  - 2023-2024
  - In this project, I am exploring the use of diffusion models for refining image segmentation tasks. Building on recent advances in generative modeling, I aim to leverage the Unleashing Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Visual Perception (VPD) framework to enhance the accuracy and robustness of image segmentation techniques. The resulting method could have applications in medical imaging, autonomous systems, and other domains where precise object detection and delineation are critical.
